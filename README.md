## About
RSA is an addon that can announce spell casts to various chat channels. There is a large selection of abilities for each class that RSA can announce, such  as interrupts, defensive cooldowns, and utility spells e.g Soulstone.

## Classic Support
RSA Currently does not support classic. Support for classic may come in the upcoming weeks.

## Options
You can open RSA's configuration window by typing **/rsa** in chat. You can alternatively go to the addon settings tab in the Interface options, and find RSA in your list of addons, which has a button to open RSA's configuration panel.
### Announcement Conditions
You can configure RSA to only send messages when you are doing certain content or under certain conditions:

* **PvP:** Choose whether to enable in Arenas, Battlegrounds, and War Mode.
* **PvE:** Choose whether to enable in manually formed Dungeons, Raids, LFG Dungeons, LFG Raids, or out in the world when War Mode is off.
* Choose whether to only announce in Combat
* Whispers can be set to ignore the PvP & PvE settings to allow them to always whisper targets. Useful if you always want to let someone know when you're resurrecting them for example.

### Messages
* The messages sent by RSA are completely customisable, you can add several messages for each announcement, and RSA will choose a random one to use each time.
* You can remove messages by simply clearing the box containing your message and pressing enter, this will remove it from the list of potential messages.
* If you have no messages for a given spell or section, then it will not announce.
* You can use the Tags below in your messages to make your messages more informative.
    
### Tags
Every spell uses the first two tags, other tags are usable only on spells where they would return anything useful.

* **[SPELL]** will be replaced with the name of the spell.
* **[LINK]** will be replaced by a clickable spell link of the spell cast.
* **[TARGET]** will be replaced with the target of the spell.
* **[AMOUNT]** will be replaced with the amount of damage or healing done.
* **[MISSTYPE]** will be replaced with Immune/Blocked/Resisted etc.
* **[AURA]** will be replaced with the buff or debuff removed by dispels.
* **[AURALINK]** will be replaced with a clickable spell link of the buff or debuff removed by dispels.
* **[TARCAST]** will be replaced by the spell that you have just interrupted.
* **[TARLINK]** will be replaced by a clickable spell link of the spell that you have just interrupted.

### Channels
Each spell can be announced in a variety of different channels:

* **Local** - Sends a message locally only visible to you. You can choose which part of your UI this is sent to in the Local Message Output Area in the General Options.
* **Instance** - Sends to /instance if you're in an instance group.
* **Raid** - Sends to /raid or /instance depending on what is most appropriate.
