# RSA r534-Release

### Shadowlands
* This is a basic update to RSA to make it functional with the Shadowlands update. A significant rework is currently in progress that will hopefully be ready before Shadowlands releases. This new version of RSA will unfortunately mean that all of your settings will be lost. Much of the configuration will be similar but becuase this new version of RSA will allow you to add your own spells as well as further customise the functionality of defaultly included spells, it was much easier to change the way settings are stored.
