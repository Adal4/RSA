# RSA r529-Alpha

### Changes
* RSA should now also run a version check with your guild members.

### Fixes
* RSA should no longer warn you about newer versions if they are of a more unstable release type. i.e if you are using the release versions, you should no longer get warned about newer beta or alpha versions.
